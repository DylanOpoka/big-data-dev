# Dylan Opoka

## Current:
  I am a senior in my last semester working on my B.S. in cyber security.
  
## Background:
  My hometown is a small town named Orrick, Missouri that is about 30 miles East of Kansas City. I have lived in Orrick all my life, and the only college I have attended is Northwest Missouri State University. In my free I like to play video games and hang out with friends. 
  
## Plans:
  After graduation, I hope to get a full time job that involves my cyber security degree. I'm not picky and don't really have a preference for what area I want to work in. However, I always thought penetration testing and the ethical hacking side of cyber security would be fun.
  
## Skills:
  - Bash 
  - Powershell
